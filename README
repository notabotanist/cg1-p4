Computer Graphics 1
Project 4 README

-----------------------------

Developed and tested on Ubuntu machines at home and in the lab.

Building Instructions:
I had to nastily modify the Makefile so that it would work both at home and on
the lab machines, due to the different locations of SOIL.  Please be sure to
use the included Makefile.

Scene:
This program renders a stereoscopic viewport of the scene.  It is a cross-eye
type of stereogram, so to get the 3d effect, cross your eyes until the two
images overlap and come into focus.

"Gameplay":
Your UNV (Unmanned Noclip Vehicle) is equipped with a laser targeting device.
Clicking the mouse while the view is centered on an enemy radar installation
will mark it for orbital bombardment.  Note that the on-screen reticle is 
positioned in space in front of the camera, so placing a radar station in the
middle of either of the reticles will cause a miss.  Should you click the mouse
while pointing at an invalid target, a red X will flash as indication.

The city is occupied by an enemy force, coordinated by the patrolling command
zeppelin.  Your objective is to destroy the zeppelin, but it is guarded from
orbital attack by a set of shield generators positioned around the city.
First paint the generators; when they are all destroyed, the zeppelin's shield
will go down.
